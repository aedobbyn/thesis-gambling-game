### Game Instructions

###Economic Investing Game Instructions: Game 1

This is the first of two investment games. For this task, you will play three rounds of an economic game. During each round, you will invest a total of $10 between three pots. Each pot has three possible outcomes that will determine what happens to the money invested in that pot.


Below is a description of the possible outcomes associated with each pot. Once you invest a portion of the $10 in each pot, each outcome has a 33% chance of being randomly selected by the computer.


For example, if you invest money in Pot 2, you have a 33% chance of doubling that investment, a 33% chance of getting that investment back exactly, and a 33% chance of getting only 40% of that investment back.



*Game 1*   | Pot 1   | Pot 2   | Pot 3
---------- | ------- | ------- | -----
Outcome 1  | 150%    | 200%    | 240%  |
Outcome 2  | 100%    | 100%    | 100%  |
Outcome 3  | 90%     | 40%     | 0%    |

The total amount of money you have made from each pot will be calculated at the end of each round. In other words:

	Total for each round =  
	(money invested in Pot 1 * randomly selected Outcome of pot 1) +   
	(money invested in Pot 2 * randomly selected Outcome of pot 2) +   
	(money invested in Pot 3 * randomly selected Oecome of pot 3)

#### An Example


For instance, let’s say during Round 1 that you decided to invest:
 $4 in Pot 1, $3 in Pot 2, and $3 in Pot 3. 
This works because $4 + $3 + $3 = $10. 

Then the computer would randomly select one of the three outcomes for each pot. Let’s say the computer selected Outcome 2, then Outcome 3, then Outcome 1.


*Example 1*  | Bid     | Outcome | Subtotal
------------ | ------- | ------- | --------
Pot 1        | $4.00   | 100%    | $4.00  |
Pot 2        | $3.00   | 40%     | $1.20  |
Pot 3        | $3.00   | 240%    | $7.20  |


For that round, you’d make:  

	($4 * 100%) +  
	($3 * 40%) +  
	($3 * 240%)  
	= $4 + $1.20 + $7.20  
	= $12.40



So, from investing $10 originally, you would have made $12.40.

After that first round you’d play two more rounds. The totals from the three rounds will be averaged to determine your winnings at the end of the game.






Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the outcomes. Then, without using any scratch paper, please, decide how much of the $10 you will invest in each pot for rounds 1, 2, and 3.

Please let the experimenter know if you have any questions.

### Economic Investing Game Instructions: Game 2

Next you will play a new version of the game you just played. The outcomes are different, but each outcome still has a 33% chance of being randomly selected by the computer.

Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the outcomes. Then, again without using scratch paper, decide how much of the $10 you will invest in each pot for each of the three rounds. 

Please let the experimenter know if you have any questions.




*Game 2*   | Pot 1   | Pot 2   | Pot 3
---------- | ------- | ------- | -----
Outcome 1  | 200%    | 300%    | 400%  |
Outcome 2  | 100%    | 100%    | 100%  |
Outcome 3  | 50%     | 33%     | 25%   |
